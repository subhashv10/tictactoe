This is a very, very simple Android game I made in which you can play tic-tac-toe against an AI opponent. 

It was build just to experiment with making an Android app, learning the SDK etc.

The AI logic comes from a [tictactoe library](http://github.com/brownmatt/tictactoe) I made earlier, which was just a chance to learn/demonstrate some Path Finding algorithms from the [Algorithms in a Nutshell](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516246) book.
